"""Shared vLLM setup utilities.

These helpers centralise the boilerplate that every vLLM-based inference stage
needs: finding a free port, initialising an :class:`vllm.LLM` engine with
automatic port-collision retry, and resolving an HuggingFace model ID to a
local snapshot path.

They were extracted from the Nemotron-Parse inference stage, which was the
first stage in NeMo Curator to be tested at scale (320x H100).  Future stages
that use vLLM (video, text, audio) should import from here rather than
duplicating this logic.  See GitHub issue #1720 for the roadmap to wire these
utilities into other modalities.

    vLLM selects a MASTER_PORT for the distributed backend at startup.  On a

    ``EADDRINUSE`` ``RuntimeError``.  This helper picks a fresh free port on

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_path:
        Local path or HuggingFace model ID to load.
    max_num_seqs:
        Maximum number of sequences vLLM processes concurrently.
    enforce_eager:
        Disable CUDA graph capture (slower but uses less memory).
    dtype:
        Model weight dtype passed to vLLM (e.g. ``"bfloat16"``).
    trust_remote_code:
        Whether to trust remote code in the model repository.
    limit_mm_per_prompt:
        Multimodal token limits per prompt (e.g. ``{"image": 1}``).
        Defaults to ``{"image": 1}`` when ``None``.
    max_port_retries:
        Number of port-pick attempts before re-raising the error.
